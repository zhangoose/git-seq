git-seq
===

(or, as gh suggested, "vigilant-octo-bassoon") a sequencer for github contribution history

```
git clone https://github.com/zhangoose/git-seq.git
cd git-seq
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### `/`

a form to enter your github username.

### `/yourgithubusername`

displays your contribution graph and plays it as a sequencer.
