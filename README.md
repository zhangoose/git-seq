git-seq
===

(or, as gh suggested, "vigilant-octo-bassoon") a sequencer for github contribution history

![demo](https://d17oy1vhnax1f7.cloudfront.net/items/0831263E2F2m2K2s1z3W/Screen%20Recording%202017-01-16%20at%2004.56%20PM.gif?v=3857eff5)

make sure you have your sound up! (but not too up)

### Running Locally

```
git clone https://github.com/zhangoose/git-seq.git
cd git-seq
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### `/`

a form to enter your github username.

### `/yourgithubusername`

displays your contribution graph and plays it as a sequencer.
